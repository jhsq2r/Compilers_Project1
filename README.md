This program is designed to take in code as input through one of 3 ways:
./Project1 [filename]
./Project1
./Project1 < [filename]
Doing the second option will let the user enter in code until they enter the EOF command CTRL+D
The program will then tokenize the code in the file and output it to the screen

Note: While I know my code functions, I'm not sure if it is correct in terms of how our future projects will work. So please
let me know what I need to change. Thank you

Known Errors: Sometimes the line number will be incorrect for the EOF Token
